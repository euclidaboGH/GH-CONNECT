# GreenHaven — GH Connect

**Current source version:** `0.90.8`

GH Connect is the GreenHaven social, matching, community, messaging, marketplace, and GHC utility platform.

## Engineering and release safety

- Use Node.js `24.15.0` or the compatible Node 24 runtime specified by `.nvmrc` and `package.json`.
- Install locked dependencies with `npm ci`.
- Run `npm run verify:static`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` before release.
- Database migration inventory is source metadata only. It does not prove migrations are applied to Testnet or Mainnet. Reconcile remote migration history and validate review-required migrations on disposable PostgreSQL/Testnet before applying them.
- Financial balances, rewards, payments, and entitlements must remain server-authoritative. Do not add client-side financial authority, fabricated financial data, or authentication/RLS bypasses.

See `docs/PROJECT_TRUTH.md`, `docs/MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md`, and `PHASE-26-SURGICAL-RELIABILITY-FIXES.md` for release constraints and current verification limits.
